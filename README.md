# Homework 2 - Branching - Wine Reviews Analysis
This project was created for the AI and Technology Academy GitHub Assignment 2. It uses the "Wine Reviews" dataset from Kaggle to convert wine ratings into star ratings and performs analysis.

## Project Details
- **Dataset**: winemag-data-130k-v2.csv (Downloaded from Kaggle, not uploaded to GitHub, excluded via .gitignore).
- **Code**: `wine_analysis.py` - Converts ratings to stars, performs country-based analysis, and generates a graph.
- **Graph**: `star_distribution.png` - Displays the distribution of star ratings.
- **Branches**:
  - **main**: Original code with a skyblue graph color.
  - **feature-color-change**: Graph color changed to orange.

## Requirements
